# Netsol-Recruitment-Assignment
 
In this assinment i completed core task 1,2,4 and also completed the bonus task 1,3.

I createad an object pool for bullets and enemies. Initliazed enemies on top of buildings using WRLD Api and also moved the plane left, right, forwards and backwards using the setoriginpoint method. 

I also created a shooting mechanism for auto targetting of enemies but because of the change in the position of gameobjects due to setoriginmethod my bullets are not currently hitting there targets.
